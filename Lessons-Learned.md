- 🧩 **Root causes or system patterns:**  
- 🔄 **What we’d do differently next time:**  
- 🌀 **New or reinforced tacit knowledge:**

> 🔐 This file honors the value of both **explicit knowledge** (books, models, frameworks) and **tacit knowledge** (intuition, identity, timing, and learned-in-the-field wisdom). By documenting lessons learned, we build an archive of insight that deepens execution intelligence over time.
