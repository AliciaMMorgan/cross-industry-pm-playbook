# Lessons Learned: Cross-Industry Program & Project Leadership

Transitioning across sectors — from aerospace and defense to nonprofits, education, and innovation spaces — has required not only technical fluency but deep adaptability. These lessons reflect lived experiences from engineering to executive leadership, and they’re shaped by trusted insights from my [Innovation & Leadership Reading List](https://github.com/AliciaMMorgan/cross-industry-pm-playbook/blob/main/Innovation_Leadership_Reading_List.md). This is not an exhaustive list — consider it a field-tested starting point.

Each lesson is paired with recommended readings (books or research articles) drawn from the reading list. You may add more over time as you deepen your journey.

## Lesson 1: Trust Is Not Automatically Transferable

Credibility in one sector does not guarantee trust in another. It must be re-earned with context sensitivity, shared language, and new proof points. Leaders must build “innovation capital” over time, not expect inherited authority to carry over.

- *The Go-Giver* by Bob Burg and John David Mann
- *The Four Factors of Trust* by Ashley Reichheld and Amelia Dunlop

## Lesson 2: Know Your Communication Style — And Theirs

As an engineer, I leaned toward technical precision. But thriving across domains requires fluency in both **direct** and **indirect** communication. You must move fluidly between data and narrative and recognize how team chemistry, culture, and communication norms vary widely.

Self-assessment tools like **Deloitte’s Business Chemistry** and a 360° feedback process can surface blind spots and help decode organizational culture.

## Lesson 3: Expertise ≠ Influence in a New Domain

You may be a subject-matter expert or seasoned leader, but in a new industry, influence must be rebuilt. Name-dropping, pedigrees, or networks don’t guarantee traction. Influence requires earned relevance, aligned incentives, and contextual trust.

**Supporting research**:  
- “Being Well-Connected Isn’t Always Good for Your Career” — *Harvard Business Review*, July 4, **2025**  
  (Explores how connections to high-status individuals can create biased performance expectations, for better or worse.)

**Supporting books**:
- *Innovation Capital* by Jeff Dyer, Nathan Furr, and Curtis Lefrandt
- *How to Become a Rainmaker* by Jeffrey J. Fox

## Lesson 4: Understand Risk Attitudes — Yours and Theirs

Not everyone resists change because they’re “rigid” — they may simply have different **risk attitudes**: risk-averse, risk-tolerant, risk-seeking, or risk-neutral. Understanding these profiles in your team and leadership can unlock more productive conversations and solutions.

## Lesson 5: Deliver Value, Not Just Work

Cross-sector leaders must speak the language of value. Can you link what you deliver to the business impact? Business acumen — understanding ROI, trade-offs, and strategic alignment — is non-negotiable.

**PMI’s Value Equation**:  
Business Value > Effort + Expense

**Supporting reads**:
- *The First 90 Days* by Michael D. Watkins

## Lesson 6: Embrace a Growth Mindset — Especially When You Fail

Engineers are trained for precision, but ambiguity and iteration define most modern work environments. Project plans can unravel. Deliverables may shift. What matters is how you respond: regroup, recover, and **extract insight** from failure.

Capture lessons learned — and **act on them**.

**Supporting ideas**:
- Value stream mapping
- Postmortems + iterative improvement cycles

## Lesson 7: Celebrate Small Wins

You may be aiming for breakthrough success, but **breaking in** and gaining early traction are critical milestones. Recognize and reward progress, not just perfection.

**Note**: Early-stage success in a new industry often comes from relational momentum, not just technical delivery.

**Supporting ideas**:  
- Milestone retrospectives  
- Strategic storytelling

## Lesson 8: Strategic Volunteering Builds Trust

Volunteering — when done strategically — accelerates access, visibility, and trust in new domains. It allows you to demonstrate value, explore fit, and build credibility without forcing a formal role.

This was pivotal in my nonprofit pivot: volunteering gave me real context and relationships before seeking leadership roles.

**Supporting read**:  
- *Rules of Engagement: Making Connections Last* by Dr. Froswa’ Booker-Drew

## Lesson 9: Reputation Travels — Make Sure It’s Consistent

Your reputation is your brand, but it must be curated across platforms and industries. Know what you want to be known for. Do your references align with that story? Do your digital and real-world footprints reinforce your credibility?

**Supporting practices**:
- Intentional reputation audits
- Strategic references and endorsements

---

## Lesson 10: Apply the Innovator’s DNA — Everywhere

Innovators share five common habits: associating, questioning, observing, networking, and experimenting. These are essential no matter the industry or role. You don’t need to be the inventor, but you do need to think and act like a **cross-industry innovator**.
