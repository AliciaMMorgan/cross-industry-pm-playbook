# Lessons Learned: Cross-Industry Program & Project Leadership

Transitioning across sectors — from aerospace and defense to nonprofits, education, and innovation spaces — has required not only technical fluency but deep adaptability. These lessons reflect lived experiences from engineering to executive leadership, and they’re shaped by trusted insights from my [Innovation & Leadership Reading List](https://github.com/AliciaMMorgan/cross-industry-pm-playbook/blob/main/Innovation_Leadership_Reading_List.md). This is not an exhaustive list — consider it a field-tested starting point.

Each lesson is paired with recommended readings (books or research articles) drawn from the reading list. You may add more over time as you deepen your journey.

## Lesson 1: Trust Is Not Automatically Transferable

Credibility in one sector does not guarantee trust in another. It must be re-earned with context sensitivity, shared language, and new proof points. Leaders must build “innovation capital” over time, not expect inherited authority to carry over.

## Lesson 2: Know Your Communication Style — And Theirs

As an engineer, I leaned toward technical precision. But thriving across domains requires fluency in both **direct** and **indirect** communication. You must move fluidly between data and narrative and recognize how team chemistry, culture, and communication norms vary widely.

Self-assessment tools like **Deloitte’s Business Chemistry** and a 360° feedback process can surface blind spots and help decode organizational culture.

## Lesson 3: Expertise ≠ Influence in a New Domain

You may be a subject-matter expert or seasoned leader, but in a new industry, influence must be rebuilt. Name-dropping, pedigrees, or networks don’t guarantee traction. Influence requires earned relevance, aligned incentives, and contextual trust.

## Lesson 4: Understand Risk Attitudes — Yours and Theirs

Not everyone resists change because they’re “rigid” — they may simply have different **risk attitudes**: risk-averse, risk-tolerant, risk-seeking, or risk-neutral. Understanding these profiles in your team and leadership can unlock more productive conversations and solutions.

## Lesson 5: Deliver Value, Not Just Work

Cross-sector leaders must speak the language of value. Can you link what you deliver to the business impact? Business acumen — understanding ROI, trade-offs, and strategic alignment — is non-negotiable.

**PMI’s Value Equation**:  
Business Value > Effort + Expense

## Lesson 6: Embrace a Growth Mindset — Especially When You Fail

Engineers are trained for precision, but ambiguity and iteration define most modern work environments. Project plans can unravel. Deliverables may shift. What matters is how you respond: regroup, recover, and **extract insight** from failure.

Capture lessons learned — and **act on them**.

**Supporting ideas**:
- Value stream mapping
- Postmortems + iterative improvement cycles

## Lesson 7: Celebrate Small Wins

You may be aiming for breakthrough success, but **breaking in** and gaining early traction are critical milestones. Recognize and reward progress, not just perfection.

**Note**: Early-stage success in a new industry often comes from relational momentum, not just technical delivery.

**Supporting ideas**:  
- Milestone retrospectives  
- Strategic storytelling

---

## Lesson 8: Strategic Volunteering Builds Trust

Volunteering — when done strategically — accelerates access, visibility, and trust in new domains. It allows you to demonstrate value, explore fit, and build credibility without forcing a formal role.

This was pivotal in my nonprofit pivot: volunteering gave me real context and relationships before seeking leadership roles.

## Lesson 9: Reputation Travels — Make Sure It’s Consistent

Your reputation is your brand, but it must be curated across platforms and industries. Know what you want to be known for. Do your references align with that story? Do your digital and real-world footprints reinforce your credibility?

**Supporting practices**:
- Intentional reputation audits
- Strategic references and endorsements

## Lesson 10: Apply the Innovator’s DNA to Every Industry

No matter what sector you enter — education, nonprofit, defense, or tech — the ability to **innovate across boundaries** is critical. One of the most transferable and powerful frameworks I’ve used is drawn from *The Innovator’s DNA*, developed by Jeff Dyer, Hal Gregersen, and Clayton Christensen.

Their research, published in the Harvard Business Review, identifies five key behaviors that drive disruptive innovation. These aren’t limited to tech entrepreneurs — they’re tools that cross-industry PMs, program leaders, and change agents can apply daily.

### 🧠 The Innovator’s DNA: 5 Key Behaviors

1. **Associating**  
   The ability to **connect seemingly unrelated ideas** across disciplines to spark new insights or solutions.  
   *Example:* A project manager with aerospace experience applies risk modeling frameworks to nonprofit funding strategies.

2. **Questioning**  
   Constantly asking “what if,” “why,” and “how” to challenge the status quo and surface unseen assumptions.  
   *Example:* “Why do we run this process quarterly — what would happen if we did it monthly instead?”

3. **Observing**  
   Watching customers, users, or environments closely to identify pain points, workarounds, or opportunities.  
   *Example:* Observing how a community uses a resource center differently than expected, prompting a shift in program design.

4. **Networking**  
   Seeking out diverse perspectives — especially from people outside your usual circle or industry — to expand your understanding.  
   *Example:* A PM in education connects with a cybersecurity leader to rethink student data protection.

5. **Experimenting**  
   Testing ideas quickly and cheaply through pilots, prototypes, or process tweaks.  
   *Example:* Running a low-risk trial of a new workflow before rolling it out across the full team.

These skills are not just for "creatives" — they are critical tools for **delivering value**, especially when entering a new sector where legacy approaches may not be effective. Leaning into these behaviors has helped me navigate ambiguity, build credibility, and spark transformation from the inside out.

## Lesson 11: Managing Risk and Maximizing Impact Under Constraints

Working on capital projects within a Fortune 500 environment, I consistently managed a **10% management reserve**—a best practice that ensured project delivery stayed on time and within budget. This financial buffer enabled proactive risk mitigation without compromising **performance**.

Later, in nonprofit program leadership, **there was no reserve—only ingenuity**. Budgets were secured mid-stream, and partnerships were forged in real time to extend reach and improve outcomes. I learned to navigate uncertainty by **maximizing impact with minimal resources**, leaning into collaboration, shared goals, and efficient program design.

Whether in capital-intensive or under-resourced environments, **strategic constraint management** became a throughline—evidence of both sound business acumen and adaptive leadership.

## Lesson 12: Curate Your Digital Presence for the Level You’re Aiming For

As you grow into more strategic, cross-functional, or executive roles, **your digital footprint should evolve too**. What helped establish credibility in the past—especially tactical content or legacy platforms—can quietly undermine your positioning if it no longer aligns with your current focus.

Recently, I discovered that my outdated SlideShare account—with an old website and context-heavy decks—was still appearing high in search results. It didn’t reflect how I lead today, and I hadn’t touched it in years. That was a clear signal: it was time to reassess what’s still representing me online.

This isn't about erasing the past—it’s about **clarity and alignment**. Just like an executive summary focuses on what matters most for today’s decision, your digital presence should support the business value you bring now.

## ✅ Key Takeaways
- Archive or remove content that no longer reflects your strategic direction.
- Retire platforms that no longer support your goals—even if they once drove visibility.
- Keep your public presence aligned with your current value proposition and leadership voice.

> Growth isn’t just about adding—it’s about **refining**.

## Lesson 13: Seek Nonlinear Mentors—Especially Weak Ties Across Industries

Some of the most valuable mentors in my journey came from outside my direct field—and that’s what made them so impactful. While I’m an engineer by training, I’ve learned just as much from nonprofit leaders, educators, and innovators in adjacent spaces. One mentor, an engineer who transitioned into nonprofit executive leadership, helped me shift from focusing on outputs to driving meaningful outcomes. Their perspective helped shape my leadership approach as a VP of Education and Programs in a mission-driven organization.

This reflects the power of **weak ties**, a concept introduced by sociologist Mark Granovetter. His research shows that people we know casually or across domains often introduce the most novel opportunities and ideas. Strong ties tend to reinforce familiar knowledge and networks, while weak ties connect us to different industries, disciplines, and worldviews. These broader perspectives are essential for building innovation capital and understanding challenges through multiple lenses—from customers to stakeholders to communities.

## ✅ Key Takeaways

- Seek mentors who challenge your thinking and expand your perspective.  
- Weak ties connect you to new opportunities, ideas, and sectors.  
- Innovation thrives at the intersection of **cross-functional** disciplines and experiences.  
- Both formal and informal mentors shape leadership in different, valuable ways.

## Lesson 14: Failure *Is* an Option—and a Critical Part of Growth

The phrase “failure is not an option” sounds heroic, but in real life, failure happens—and often teaches us more than success. You can do everything right and still fall short of your goal. What matters is how you respond. I failed the PMP exam on my first attempt, yet still went on to lead major projects and programs. When I returned to it more than a decade later, I passed—because I approached it differently. I broke it into stages, took frequent practice exams, and focused on identifying the critical path to success instead of assuming one perfect approach.

Failure isn’t always dramatic it can be a slow miss, a close call, or a plan that doesn’t deliver the intended outcome. The key is to treat it as a learning cycle: What worked? What didn’t? What did I miss? Do I need to observe someone else in action or volunteer to close skill gaps? Growth comes from honest retrospectives and a willingness to revise your strategy. Resilience isn't avoiding failure—it's learning how to navigate through it smarter the next time.

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways

- Failure is part of the path—not proof you’re on the wrong one.  
- A growth mindset turns setbacks into stepping stones.  
- Break down big goals into stages and build a clearer path to success.  
- Use retrospectives to reflect, adapt, and improve.  
- Strategic observation and volunteering can help close unseen gaps.
