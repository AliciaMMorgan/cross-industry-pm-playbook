## 🔑 Influence, Trust & Communication Across Organizations

> Influence is about pull, not push. You build trust over time, not by title alone but through credibility, clarity, and consistent contribution. Understand that power exists at **every level of an organization**. Executive titles don’t always mean decision-making authority, and grassroots champions often hold the key to momentum.

Tailoring communication to your audience — whether pitching ideas, managing up, or building coalitions — is essential. These resources help decode the **language of decision-makers** and foster collaboration across hierarchical and matrix structures.
