A Practical Guide for Leading Innovation Across Sectors

👋 Welcome

This playbook is a living document inspired by my journey from traditional project management in technical environments (aerospace, defense) to innovation leadership across nonprofits, education, and enterprise organizations. It’s designed to help project managers, innovation leaders, and cross-functional teams build from structure into adaptive agility—without losing clarity or execution discipline.

⸻

📌 Why This Playbook?

I created this to:
	•	Show how structure enables innovation—not blocks it.
	•	Offer a real-world toolkit rooted in practice, not theory.
	•	Share lessons from leading digital transformation and strategic programs in both resource-rich and resource-constrained environments.

⸻

🔧 Part 1: The Foundation (Traditional Project Management)

This section outlines the standard practices and frameworks that shaped my PM roots:

▪️ Project Lifecycle
	•	Initiation → Planning → Execution → Monitoring → Closure

▪️ Governance & Roles
	•	Sample RACI charts, stakeholder maps, sponsor engagement

▪️ Methodologies & Tools
	•	Waterfall, early hybrid methods
	•	Tools: MS Project, Smartsheet, Excel trackers
	•	Templates: Project Charters, Risk Logs, Status Reports (linked)

⸻

🌉 Part 2: Bridging into Innovation (Cross-Sector Adaptability)

I transitioned into nonprofit and education environments where creativity, resourcefulness, and people-centered design became essential.

▪️ Case: Dallas College Digital Transformation
	•	Collaborated across departments to connect industry and workforce needs
	•	Led facilitation to identify skill gaps and map tech solutions

▪️ Case: After-School Program Strategy
	•	Facilitated program redesign through research, empathy interviews, and volunteer board leadership
	•	Shifted from leading to facilitating conversations and co-design

⸻

🚀 Part 3: Innovation in Action (Agility in Ambiguity)

Now, I work at the intersection of structure and experimentation—helping orgs balance process maturity with adaptive delivery.

▪️ Executive Nonprofit Leadership
	•	Built scalable program models, drove stakeholder alignment, and implemented agile reporting practices

▪️ Consulting & PMP Credentialing
	•	Earned my PMP to bridge language with enterprise leaders
	•	Use Agile metrics, retrospectives, and continuous learning
