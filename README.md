# A Practical Guide for Leading Innovation Across Sectors

👋 **Welcome**

This playbook is a living document inspired by my journey from traditional project management in technical environments (aerospace, defense) to innovation leadership across nonprofits, education, and enterprise organizations. It’s designed to help project managers, innovation leaders, and cross-functional teams build from structure into adaptive agility, without losing clarity or execution discipline.

📇 About Me

I'm Alicia M. Morgan—a PMP-certified project strategist with a foundation in aerospace and industrial engineering. I began my career leading technical execution, lean manufacturing, and capital improvement projects in regulated, high-stakes environments. Over time, I transitioned into the nonprofit and education sectors, bringing structured thinking into more ambiguous spaces while expanding my focus on innovation, digital transformation, and strategic program design.
My work has earned national and regional recognition. I’m a Dallas Business Journal Women in Technology Awards Advocate Honoree and have been featured in:

- 🧠 **PMI Webinar**: Presenter of *Empathetic Leadership: A Key to Effective Project Management* (20K+ views, 4★+ rating) 
- 🎤 **TEDx Plano**: Speaker embracing a growth mindset, innovation, and inclusion
- 🔬 **Society of Women Engineers**: “Women Engineers You Should Know” feature and SWE23 conference inspirational insight sessions speaker on the topic of “Strategic Leadership: Empowering Teams to Win”
- 📘 **PM World Journal**: Featured for global project and program management insights
- 🌀 **AgileCon 2024 (International Institute for Learning)**: Speaker on "Strategic Yet Agile: Leading with Innovation"
- 💼 **Crain’s Chicago Business**: Featured article on cross-sector and generational leadership
- 🌐 **National Informal STEM Education (NISE) Network**: Featured for innovation in science and education engagement

These experiences underscore my ability to translate structure into strategy and scalable innovation. Whether leading from the front or facilitating from behind the scenes, I help organizations move from clarity to creativity, without losing business value along the way.

📌 **Why This Playbook?**

I created this to:
- Show how structure enables innovation, rather than blocking it.
- Offer a practical toolkit grounded in real-world applications, not theoretical concepts.
- Share lessons from leading digital transformation and strategic programs in both resource-rich and resource-constrained environments.

🧠 **What Guides My Thinking: Business Chemistry®**

According to Deloitte's Business Chemistry®, I am a **primary Driver** and **secondary Guardian**. This unique combination fuels how I lead in both structured and fluid environments:

- As a **Driver**, I value logic, results, and focused execution. I lead with clarity, distill complexity into outcomes, and welcome a challenge that sharpens strategy.
- As a **Guardian**, I respect structure, risk-awareness, and rigor. I’m methodical, dependable, and capable of navigating regulated or traditional settings with care.

🎯 **Why it matters**: This pairing allows me to bridge compliance-heavy organizations with creative, adaptive environments. I bring both engineering precision and innovative flexibility—critical when leading change, aligning stakeholders, and scaling new approaches.
