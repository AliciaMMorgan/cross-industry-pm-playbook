# Best Practices: Making AI Work for Your Team

AI is only as strong as the people who use it. These best practices help align technology with culture, capability, and strategy.

## Top Best Practices

### 1. Start with Pilots
Test in low-stakes environments. Gather feedback and refine before scaling.

### 2. Document Lessons Continuously
Don’t wait for the end of a project—capture insights along the way.

### 3. Humanize Training
Use real tasks and problems—not abstract tool demos—to help your team connect with new tools.

### 4. Integrate AI into Existing Workflows
Meet people where they are. Avoid disrupting systems that already work well.

### 5. Communicate Value Often
Reinforce how AI improves outcomes—not just speed, but clarity, insight, and decision-making.

## Tip

Every rollout is a culture moment. Use it to reinforce values, build trust, and unlock innovation.
