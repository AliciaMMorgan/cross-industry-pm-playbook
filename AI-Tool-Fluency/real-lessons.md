# Real Lessons from the Field: AI Fluency in Practice

This file captures real-world insights from leadership, PM, and innovation work across sectors, drawn from observing how teams react to, adapt to, or resist AI integration.

## Key Takeaways

- **AI = Organizational Change**: Introducing AI tools is less about tech and more about change management.
- **Perception of Replacement**: Like lean manufacturing or Six Sigma, AI adoption can trigger fear—"Am I being replaced?" Leadership must proactively address this.
- **Human Insight Still Wins**: Tools are powerful, but critical thinking, context, and stakeholder sense-making remain irreplaceable.
- **Past Lessons Apply**: Insights from earlier career stages (e.g., leading capital projects) still hold: People don’t resist change—they resist *being changed*.

## Real Scenarios

- While supporting nonprofit innovation, introducing AI prompted educators to express concern about their roles being diminished.
- Deploying meeting intelligence tools revealed hidden bottlenecks—but only worked when framed as empowering support, not surveillance.
- AI tools accelerated workflows, but only after ambassadors were empowered to guide their teams through learning curves.

> These are not hypotheticals. These are learned, observed, and still evolving in practice.
