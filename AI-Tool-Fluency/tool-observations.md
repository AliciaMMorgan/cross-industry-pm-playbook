# Tool Observations: What Works, What Doesn’t

Over time, I've tested and deployed various AI-powered tools. Here's a summary of observed patterns—beyond the hype.

## What Works Well

- **Otter.ai / Zoom AI Companion / Fireflies.ai**
  - Effective for reducing notetaking burden.
  - Summaries enable more strategic participation and follow-ups.
  - Resistance fades when users see summaries help them—not just the manager.

- **ChatGPT / Claude**
  - Great for ideation, drafts, and synthesizing.
  - Must be trained to your context; prompt quality matters.
  - Teams need coaching to move from generic to domain-specific use.

- **Canva AI / Microsoft Designer**
  - Enables faster visual storytelling.
  - Especially helpful for those without design backgrounds.

## What to Watch Out For

- Tools that feel “monitoring-based” (e.g., meeting trackers) need framing.
- Without psychological safety, tool fatigue sets in quickly.
- Implementation without fluency ≠ transformation.

> Observation is a leadership skill. Capture what you see, listen deeply, and use those insights to guide adoption.
