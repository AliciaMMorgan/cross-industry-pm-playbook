# AI Deployment Principles: What Leaders Must Know

This guide distills lessons into core principles that can guide responsible and effective AI rollout across any industry or team.

## 5 Principles for People-Centered AI Deployment

1. **People First, Always**
   - AI should *augment*, not replace.
   - Co-create workflows with those who will use the tools.

2. **Build Fluency Before Speed**
   - Rushing rollout leads to mistrust.
   - Create environments for exploration and learning.

3. **Ambassadors Matter**
   - Identify and train champions to model behavior and reduce fear.

4. **Transparency Builds Trust**
   - Explain how AI works, why it's being used, and what data it touches.

5. **Tie AI to Strategy, Not Hype**
   - Don’t deploy just to say you did—deploy to solve real problems.

## Application Scenario

Imagine you're rolling out a meeting summarization tool. The principles above ensure it’s adopted as support, not surveillance.
