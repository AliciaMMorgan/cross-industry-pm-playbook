# 🎨 Curatorial Leadership & My Innovator’s DNA

This section of the Cross-Industry PM Playbook captures how I’ve led not only through formal roles or projects, but also through curating inclusive, insight-driven experiences across industries. This includes Fortune 500 business resource groups, nonprofit and museum education programs, STEAM-integrated youth initiatives, and career development events in advisory roles. Curation here is not a sidebar — it is a **core innovation and leadership competency**.

## 🧬 Innovative DNA in Action

Curation is an expression of my Innovator’s DNA — the ability to connect dots across disciplines, sense emerging needs, and design high-impact moments that reflect both organizational goals and individual growth. It blends insight, empathy, and strategic planning with cross-functional fluency.

My curatorial work has included:
- ✳️ Business Resource Groups (BRGs): As an individual contributor, curated and led events that advanced equity and visibility, influencing without authority.
- 🏛️ Museum and Informal Education: As a VP of Education & Programs, led public programs, family days, and interdisciplinary learning labs centered on accessibility, STEAM, and cultural fluency.
- 🌱 Nonprofit Learning Ecosystems: Designed after-school, school-based, and public education events aligned with learning standards and community engagement.
- 🎓 NAF Academy Advisory Board Chair: Curated and facilitated career fairs and industry exposure programs in collaboration with public high schools and local employers.
-  J Rêve International LLC: STEAM+ Arts Integration Conference Co-Chair and Contributing Author to STEAM+ Arts Integration Anthology: Insights and Practical Applications companion book 
- 📚 This very playbook and [Innovation Reading List](https://github.com/AliciaMMorgan/cross-industry-pm-playbook/blob/main/Innovation_Leadership_Reading_List.md:) is a curatorial act of synthesis and empowerment.

## 🧠 Curation as Strategic Competency

Curating isn’t just organizing — it’s insight-based sensemaking. It requires:
- Seeing patterns and gaps in audience needs  
- Translating abstract goals into meaningful experiences  
- Creating environments where people feel included, seen, and activated  
- Exercising influence without direct authority  

It’s also a visible expression of my leadership when I wasn’t “in charge,” and how I’ve built trust across functions, communities, and disciplines.

## 🔧 Frameworks That Shape My Curatorial Practice

- **Learning Styles & Reflective Practice**:  
  Recognizing diverse learning preferences (visual, auditory, reading/writing, kinesthetic) strengthens both communication and knowledge transfer. Frameworks like Bloom’s Taxonomy help design experiences for deeper engagement and reflective growth.

- **Inclusive Design & Accessibility**:  
  Events and programs I curate consider visual accessibility (contrast, layout), language clarity, neurodiversity, and assistive technologies — creating equitable participation across user needs.

- **Psychological Safety for Innovation & Inclusion**:  
  Rooted in research by Dr. Amy Edmondson, psychological safety enables team learning, risk-taking, and honest feedback. I curate experiences that make space for divergent thinking, respect dissent, and encourage inclusive contributions.

- **Generational Learning & Digital Natives**:  
  Programs are informed by how Gen Z and digital-native learners engage — valuing interactive, impact-driven messaging and culturally relevant framing.

- **Influence as Pull, Not Push**:  
  Many of my curatorial contributions were executed from positions without formal authority. Understanding strategic communication and social capital allowed me to build coalitions and shape outcomes through trust and alignment.

## 🧩 Lessons Learned Beyond the Agenda

Curation taught me:
- Leadership often happens through design, not just decision-making.
- People remember how they **felt** in an experience more than what was said.
- Cross-functional fluency means knowing how to **listen across boundaries**.
- Inclusion isn’t an afterthought — it’s in the design itself.
- Influence is earned through empathy, clarity, and trust.

## 💡 Curation as Thought-Pilot, Not Just Program Lead

Curating across sectors has made me a stronger systems thinker, storyteller, and integrator. It’s taught me to lead by **setting tone and framing possibilities**, not just managing logistics. I curate with the mindset of a **thought pilot** — charting new paths, not just repeating past agendas.

## 🔁 Feedback & Reflective Assessment
